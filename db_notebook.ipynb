    "The machine learning algorithm we decided to use in our project to predict bike availability was a tweaked version of the k-nearest neighbours algorithm. We have chosen this algorithm both for it's simplicity and, we would argue, it's suitability with some alteration for the task of predicting bike availability based on weather data. Our primary source of information for learning about this algorithm was the chapter 8.2 in Tom Mitchel's book \"Machine Learning\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the k-nearest neighbours algorithm, the instance we are trying to predict what a particular instance is based on the k (some number) \"nearest neighbours\" from out data set, that is to say the instances from our dataset that our closest to the instance being predicted in it's known qualities. This algorithm is usually used to allocate instances into discrete categories, in which cases the instance will be given the same classification as the majority of it's k-nearest neighbours. As the predictions we are assigning are continuous, we will use the average of the k-nearest neighbours, i.e. the average available bikes of the nearest neighbours selected based on similarity of weather conditions. To maximise accuracy, we will be implementing a version of k nearest neighbours outlined by Mitchell on pp.233-4, distance weighted nearest neighbours where k is all training examples. In terms of our project, this means our prediction will be based on the weighted average of all of the previous bike availability data for a station, with examples having a higher weight in the average the closer they are in weather to weather for our prediction.
